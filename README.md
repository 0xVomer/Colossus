Colossus is a secure privacy-preserving key-store for auditable-cryptographic-rights.
Policy-based security models commonly require a trusted-authority to manage access-control rights (e.g. KMS system) as well as securing resources.

Colossus provides the means for a trusted-authority to:

1. Grant rights to objects with cryptography that
2. Permit auditors to verify the historical integrity of the authority whilst preserving privacy.

With Colossus it is possible to design an auditable KMS
